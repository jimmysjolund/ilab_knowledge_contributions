# Overview

## What it is
- A flexible, open approach to making business decisions and leading projects

## When to use it
For decisions and projects that are likely to:
- impact our culture or
- affect associates beyond your immediate team

## How to use it
- Build steps from the Open Decision Framework into your project plan or decision-making process


## What is an open decision?

### Transparent
 Explain who is making the decision, what problems you're trying to solve, the requirements and constraints involved, and the process you will follow.

### Inclusive
Engage others for feedback and collaborate throughout the decision-making process. Seek out diverse perspectives, including potential detractors.

### Customer-Centric
Think of people as customers with competing needs and priorities. When a decision will help some customers, but disappoint others, manage relationships and expectations while getting stuff done.


## Open decisions are made using open source principles 

### Open exchange
Whether you're developing software or trying to solve a business problem, open exchange begins when you share your "source code" with others. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people can learn and use existing information to develop new ideas.

### Participation
When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own. And when we can implement open standards, we enable others to participate in the future.

### Release early + often
Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, and that leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. You can learn by doing.

### Meritocracy
In a meritocracy, good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas win. Everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather support and effort from the community.

### Community
Communities form around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.

## How open source principles lead to better decisions

### Principles
- Open exchange
- Participation
- Release early + often
- Meritocracy
- Community

### Practices
- Transparency with internal customers and other stakeholders
- Customer involvement
- Gain feedback and adapt iterative changes
- Ideation with customers
- Build trust and respect via collaboration 

### Outcomes
- Customer buy-in
- Stronger and faster adoption
- Best ideas win
- Fewer bugs, issues, and unanticipated impacts
- Higher associate engagement
- Decisions aligned to strategy and culture


## You can't please everyone.
**But when you make open decisions, people feel...**

- I understand why the decision was made and how it aligns with our strategy, goals, and mission.
- There was visibility to the business requirements, research, and evaluation criteria.
- The decision-making process was inclusive and transparent.
- Although I wasn't the decision-maker, I was able to contribute to the process.
- I may not agree with the decision, but it's clear that the decision-makers understand our values and culture.
- I might be disappointed, but I wasn't surprised.
- My voice was heard and valued.

# Open Decision Framework 

## Phase or activity: Concept, Define, Ideate

### Steps you can take to be open

#### Lead with transparency
- Publish a problem statement and possible approaches
- Identify any aspects of the project or decision that cannot be open
- Publish your ideation process

#### Build diversity of thought + an inclusive environment
- Engage internal customers and stakeholders early on, especially those who may disagree
- Seek out diverse and underrepresented perspectives (geographies, ethnicity, departments, job levels, gender, age, etc.)
- Champion collaboration and provide channels for feedback
- Address risks, limitations, and potential cultural impacts, especially with historically controversial issues

### Questions to ask
- What is the potential impact on the organization? On the culture?
- Who do we need to include in planning?
- Whose problem are we trying to solve?
- Who will we need or want help from?
- Who else could be impacted?
- Who has solved a similar problem?
- Who is likely to disagree, dissent, reject, or opt out? Who else may care?

### Key considerations
- Confidentiality, privacy, and regulatory requirements
- Potential to generate controversy
- Impact on culture and future decisions
- Roles + responsibilities [OPT model:]( https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/opt-model/)
- Where to publish

### Common flamewar triggers
There are a handful of issues that often generate controversy and upset within organizations, including:

- Decisions, policies, or changes that impact associates, such as rewards and wellness programs
- Changes to associates' work environment
- Implementation of proprietary technology
- Use of proprietary formats
- Data privacy and sharing

If your project or decision involves any of these themes, take extra steps to make your process open, inclusive, and transparent.

## Phase or activity: Plan, Research 

### Steps you can take to be open

#### Engage customers + collaborators
- Gather input from internal customers and those who you will need help from (surveys, interviews, focus groups, etc.)
- Make it easy to participate + manage. Ask customers which collaboration tools they prefer to use. Have a plan for consolidating and publishing feedback.
- Remain open to new information and perspectives
- Consider peer-to-peer feedback and communication options in addition to formal channels

#### Set expectations upfront
- Be specific about what type(s) of feedback you're looking for + who is making the decision(s)
- Publish decision process and project plan, with roles, dates, constraints

#### Explain the obvious
- Publish the scope of the project or decision, and reiterate often
- Publish decision factors and their relative importance
- Publish your research, including difficult trade-offs, business requirements
- To the extent possible, publish any relevant legal, reporting, or confidentiality concerns

#### Plan the transition
- Develop and gather feedback on communication, change management, and adoption plans
- Think through how you could respond to upset individuals (on memo-list and other channels)

### Questions to ask
- How will we make decisions?
- What internal customers, stakeholders, and collaborators will we involve?
- How will we engage and communicate with them?
- What are the open source options?
- How might choosing a proprietary technology or format limit our choices in the future?
- How does this align with the company strategy and mission?
- Where might this conflict with your values and culture?

#### Key considerations
- Impact – who, how often, and unexpected
- Where and how to collaborate
- Roles + responsibilities [OPT model:](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/opt-model/)

History: Where the Open Decision Framework came from 
----------------------------------------------------
_page 14 of 15_ 

  - Based on principles practiced by open source communities

    - Research by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and Diana Martin (2009 – 2010); additional community resources

  - Developed by the People team, with contributions from cross-functional focus group

    - Grew from People team Project Management Office's effort to create an open project management methodology (2012 – 2013)
    - Google Calendar memo-list conversations served as a catalyst to share drafts with all associates and invite participation (2014)
    - Tested by IT and Engineering, in the Google Calendar bridge working group (2014 – 2015)

  - Updated and maintained by [The Open Organization](https://github.com/open-organization/)


Why the framework exists 
------------------------
_page 15 of 15_ 

**A collection of proven practices that:**

  - Drive better alignment between business decisions and our company strategy, goals, culture, values, and mission
  - Demonstrate "what good looks like" in decision-making and communication
  - Offer consistent guidance for teams and leaders on Red Hat cultural expectations, balancing transparency and confidentiality
  - Improve associate engagement, signal-to-noise ratio on memo-list
